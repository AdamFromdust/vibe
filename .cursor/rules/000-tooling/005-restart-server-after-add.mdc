- **Restart Dev Server After Adding/Creating Files**
  - **Problem:** Sometimes, after adding a new component (e.g., via `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add ...`) or manually creating a new `.ts`/`.tsx` file and immediately importing it elsewhere, the development server (Next.js, Vite, etc.) might not recognize the new file instantly.
  - **Symptom:** This can lead to `Module not found` errors or linter errors complaining about unresolved imports, even if the file exists and the import path (`@/components/...`, `../lib/...`, etc.) appears correct.
  - **Solution:** If you encounter these errors right after adding or creating a file, and you've double-checked the import path, **try restarting your development server** (e.g., stop the `pnpm dev` process and start it again).
  - **Scenarios:** This is common when:
    - Using CLIs like `shadcn` to add UI components.
    - Creating new React components, utility functions, or type definition files.
    - Modifying `tsconfig.json` or other build configuration files.
