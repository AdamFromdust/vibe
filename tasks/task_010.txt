# Title: Final Integration and End-to-End Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate all components, perform comprehensive testing, and polish the UI for the final application.
# Details:
1. Integrate all components into a cohesive application
2. Perform end-to-end testing of the complete user flow
3. Optimize performance and loading times
4. Ensure consistent styling and UI polish
5. Verify accessibility compliance
6. Test on different browsers and devices
7. Implement final error handling and edge cases
8. Prepare for deployment

Checklist for final review:
- Complete user flow works from start to finish
- All UI components render correctly

- Loading states and transitions are smooth
- Accessibility requirements are met
- Performance is optimized

Deployment steps:
1. Verify environment variables are set correctly
2. Build the application for production
3. Test the production build locally
4. Deploy to the target hosting platform (e.g., Vercel)
5. Perform post-deployment testing

```bash
# Build command
npm run build

# Local production testing
npm run start

# Deploy to Vercel (if using Vercel CLI)
vercel --prod
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create a comprehensive test plan covering all features
2. Perform manual end-to-end testing of the complete user flow
3. Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. Test on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
5. Verify all error handling and edge cases
6. Conduct accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)
7. Perform performance testing (load times, TTS responsiveness)
8. Verify that the application meets all requirements specified in the PRD
