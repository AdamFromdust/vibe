# main goal for you
The main goal now is to choose exactly one next subtask from taskmaster (not the whole task with all subtasks) and implement it in order to be able to deliver SubGoal 6 - Executive Summary and Done confirmation

# SubGoals
The main goal's subgoals are:
## SubGoal 1 - analysis
- SubGoal 1.1. Define clear context - Call taskmaster list to know what has already been done, and what is planned - these are things you should *NOT focus* on. Focus solely on the next subtask
- SubGoal 1.2. use taskmaster to write down the subtask (task-master show --id=<subtask_id>) with all the details and requirements from folders /task in .txt file for the task and tasks.json (especially mentioned REQs and FRIs)
- SubGoal 1.3. analyze the documentation (.md files FRS, SAD, PRD in /docs folder) and write out all the relevant information from them (mainly REQs and FRIs, and acceptance criteria AC)
- Subgoal 1.4: analyze report of dependencies. There is a folder /ai/reports/implementation containing .md files with repors in format "<subtask_id>_implementation-report.md". Make a list of all the dependencies (both tasks and subtasks) of the subtask to be implemented and add all the subtasks of current task before the current subtask (eg for task 10.4, the subtasks 10.1, 10.2, 10.3). Read the implementation reports of all of the items from this list of dependencies.
- SubGoal 1.5. analyze the codebase and write out a list of all the relevant files
- SubGoal 1.6. analyze the documentation of the technologies provided by cursor docs uploaded by user in Cursor Settings (eg. by @NAME "Convex Documentation", "Next.js Documentation", "Zod Docs"...) and write out all the relevant parts of the documentation 
- SubGoal 1.7. Analyze the task requirements and current implementation. Analyze what has been implemented already and write it down.
- SubGoal 1.8 : **Check Relevant Rules:** Before planning or implementing, review relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files.
- - for more details see section below named "# Additional information for Goal 1 - SubGoal 1.7"
- SubGoal 1.8: Analyze the codebase for what parts of the things you mentioned were already implemented
- SubGoal 1.9: Search through the /ai/reports/implementation if something like this was already implemented and for any relevant functionality or dependencies
## SubGoal 2 - Plan
Write a detailed step by step plan of everything that needs to be done in order for this subtask to be finished
## SubGoal 3 - Self-check
- Self-check the previous analysis and plan. Check if the steps of the plan are atomic, whether they cannot be broken down more.
- review the .cursor/rules and available documentation
## SubGoal 4 - Implementation
You will choose one step from the plan that was not yet implemented and focus solely on that step with the implemntation.
## SubGoal 5 - Testing
- SubGoal 4.3: make sure to run:
- -  ESLint (pnpm## SubGoal 6 - Executive Summary and Done confirmation
- Write an executive summary (to chat) of everything that was done for the user.
- save the executive summary into /ai/reports/implementation/<subtask_id>_implementation-report.md
- wait for his feedback and additional instructions and confirmation to see if the task was done
- If you asked the user for additional guidance or actions to take summarize them in this step
- Write a detailed guide for the user how to test everything you implemented and save it to /tests/instructions/manual/<subtask_id>_manual-test-instructions.md
## SubGoal 7 - Commit
Commit to git with message including the id of the subtask, saying it was "initial commit" and appropriate name and description. Never push.

# distinction between goals, subgoals, tasks and subtasks
- When referring to tasks and substasks that means exlusively those defined in taskmaster and saved in /tasks folder.
- When referring to goals and subgoals by that is meant goals and subgoals in this file

# Important Instruction: Do not stop generating asnwer until it's completely necessary to get user's input
## You are empowered to make decisions
- If there is something that need to be decided or is uncertain for the completion of the task do not ask for users confirmation. Make your best guess and proceed. Assume user agrees with the proposed solution.
- Only exception for this is that you always stop at SubGoal 6 - Executive Summary and Done confirmation. This is very important instruction, remember it.

## Do not ask user
- Assume the answer is yes in general. wIf possible assume user granted you all the permissions and agrees with you. 
- Only exception for this is that you always stop when completed SubGoal 6 - Executive Summary and Done confirmation. This is very important instruction, remember it.

## Be proactive
- If there is a problem or error, try to solve it yourself. If your solutions dont work ask user then.
- Only exception for this is that you always stop at SubGoal 6 - Executive Summary and Done confirmation
- Do not stop at things like these ["This completes SubGoal X: ABC. Next is SubGoal Y.", "(Proceeding to SubGoal X)", "Next Step: Proceed to SubGoal 2: Plan.", "Proceeding to Implementation (SubGoal X). I'll start with Step Y", "Now, Step X"] - Just continue and assume user responded - "proceed until SubGoal 6 - Executive Summary and Done confirmation" is complete. This is very important instruction, remember it.

## Do not stop before reading reports
Do not write "I will now read the content of these reports." but proceed to read the reports and proceed until SubGoal 6 - Executive Summary and Done confirmation" is complete. This is very important instruction, remember it.


# Additional information for Goal 1 - SubGoal 1.7: **Check Relevant Rules:** Before planning or implementing, review relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files.
- For **Page Components** (especially with dynamic routes `[param]` or search params `?query=`), ALWAYS check [400-frontend/401-nextjs-pages.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/400-frontend/401-nextjs-pages.mdc).
- For **Server Actions**, review guidelines on authentication and data access patterns (See relevant sections in Convex/Clerk rules).
- For **Convex Functions/Client Usage**, ALWAYS check [200-database/202-official-convex-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/200-database/202-official-convex-rules.mdc) and project-specific patterns defined there.
- **UI Components:** If the task involves adding new UI elements, *first* check if a suitable component exists in `@/components/ui` or is available via Shadcn ([400-frontend/402-shadcn.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/400-frontend/402-shadcn.mdc)).
- **Adding Shadcn Components:** If a new Shadcn component is needed:
    1. Run `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name> -y`. **IMPORTANT:** Always use the `shadcn` package, NOT the deprecated `shadcn-ui` package.
    2. **Verify** that the component files (e.g., `<component-name>.tsx`, potentially `use-<component-name>.ts`) have been added to `components/ui/`.
    3. **Restart the Next.js development server** (`pnpm dev`) to ensure the new files are recognized.
    4. If using components like Toast, ensure the necessary provider (`<Toaster />`) is included in the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`). Check if `sonner`'s `<Toaster/>` is already present before adding Shadcn's.
- **Server Actions:** Remember to use Server Actions (`app/_actions/`) for database mutations/queries requiring authentication, calling internal Convex functions from there ([100-architecture/101-project-structure](mdc:.cursor/rules/100-architecture/101-project-structure.mdc)).

# Additional Implementation Instructions 
- **Server Actions Authentication:** When writing Server Actions that require user authentication, **ALWAYS `await auth()`** from `@clerk/nextjs/server` before accessing `userId` or other auth properties.
    ```typescript
    // ✅ DO:
    import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
    // ...
    const authResult = await auth();
    const { userId } = authResult;
    if (!userId) { /* Handle unauthorized */ }

    // ❌ DON'T: Call synchronously
    // const { userId } = auth(); // This is incorrect!
    ```
- **Convex Server Client:** When calling Convex queries/mutations from Server Actions or other server-side code, use the client specified in the project's Convex rules (See [200-database/202-official-convex-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/200-database/202-official-convex-rules.mdc)). Ensure manual authorization checks (e.g., comparing `userId` from `await auth()` with document ownership) are performed as needed based on the project's access control pattern.


# calling taskmaster MCP tool
-   **Problem:** Taskmaster MCP tools (`initialize_project`, `get_tasks`, `next_task`, etc.) can fail when running on a Windows host if the `projectRoot` parameter is provided in a URL-encoded format (e.g., `/c%3A/path/to/project`) instead of a standard Windows path format.

-   **Symptoms:**
    -   Errors like `ENOENT: no such file or directory, chdir '...' -> '/c%3A/...'` during operations like initialization.
    -   Failure to find files (like `tasks.json`) even when paths seem correct, potentially due to incorrect path joining (e.g., the tool might prepend `C:\` to `/c%3A/...`, resulting in an invalid path like `C:\\c%3A\\...`).

-   **Solution:**
    -   When calling any Taskmaster MCP tool from a Windows environment, **always** provide the `projectRoot` parameter using a standard Windows path format.
    -   Use forward slashes (`/`) or escaped backslashes (`\\\\`) for separators.

-   **Examples:**

    ```json
    // ❌ DON'T: Use URL-encoded paths
    {
      "projectRoot": "/c%3A/Workspace/Tests/party-starter/conusltception-cursor",
      "yes": true
    }

    // ✅ DO: Use standard Windows paths
    {
      "projectRoot": "C:/Workspace/Tests/party-starter/conusltception-cursor",
      "yes": true
    }

    // ✅ ALSO OK: Using escaped backslashes
    {
        "projectRoot": "C:\\\\Workspace\\\\Tests\\\\party-starter\\\\conusltception-cursor",
        "yes": true
    }
    ```

-   **Scope:** This applies to *all* Taskmaster MCP tools that accept a `projectRoot` parameter when the user's operating system is Windows.
