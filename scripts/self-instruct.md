# main goal
Our main goal now is to write .mdc instructions for you so next time you don't write incorrect code.

These instructions are appended to existing chat conversation where you first wrote code that did not work, but eventually corrected the code and wrote a final working code. User provided context in chat.

# subgoal 1 - source analysis
Write analysis why you wrote the first code that did not work

# subgoal 2 - mistakes analysis
Write analysis why you wrote the subsequent not working code

# subgoal 3 - correct implementation analysis
write down what was the final working implementation 

# subgoal 4 - write instrurctions
In the folder .cursor/rules/<appropriate_subfolder> create or append existing .mdc file with instructions that will make you implement this correctly next time
