      "taskTitle": "Create Basic UI Layout and Components",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the UI layout task into subtasks for: 1) Page structure and responsive container setup, 2) Text content and styling implementation, 3) Form components (textarea and button) with state management",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard Next.js and Shadcn/UI implementation with clear requirements. The code example is comprehensive but can be logically divided into structure, content, and interactive elements. Moderate complexity due to styling and responsiveness requirements."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Geolocation Service",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the geolocation service into subtasks for: 1) Browser Geolocation API integration, 2) Error handling and permission management, 3) Reverse geocoding implementation, 4) Timeout and fallback mechanisms",
      "reasoning": "This task involves browser APIs, asynchronous operations, error handling, and third-party service integration (reverse geocoding). The complexity comes from handling various failure modes, permissions, and implementing proper fallbacks."

      "taskTitle": "Create Backend API Endpoint for Visualization Generation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the API endpoint implementation into subtasks for: 1) Next.js API route setup, 2) Request validation and error handling, 3) OpenAI integration and prompt engineering, 4) Response formatting and error handling, 5) Security and rate limiting",
      "reasoning": "This task involves server-side code, external API integration with OpenAI, proper error handling, and security considerations. The complexity is higher due to the need for robust error handling, prompt engineering, and managing API keys securely."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Frontend API Integration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the frontend API integration into subtasks for: 1) Form submission and validation logic, 2) Loading state management, 3) API request implementation with geolocation, 4) Response handling and UI state updates",
      "reasoning": "This task requires coordinating multiple asynchronous operations (geolocation and API calls), managing loading states, and handling errors. The complexity is moderate as it builds on existing components but requires careful state management."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Visualization Display",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the visualization display implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating the visualization text display component with proper styling, 2) Implementing the instructions section and start button with event handling",
      "reasoning": "This is primarily a UI implementation task with straightforward requirements. The complexity is relatively low as it mainly involves creating React components, styling, and basic event handling without complex logic."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Text-to-Speech implementation into subtasks for: 1) Web Speech API integration, 2) Voice selection and fallback logic, 3) Speech control functions (start, stop, pause), 4) Browser compatibility and error handling",
      "reasoning": "This task involves working with the Web Speech API which has inconsistent browser support. The complexity comes from handling voice selection, browser differences, and implementing proper fallbacks. Error handling is critical as TTS can fail in various ways."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and User Feedback",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the error handling implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating reusable error components, 2) Implementing API and network error handling, 3) Adding loading indicators and state feedback, 4) Implementing retry mechanisms",
      "reasoning": "This task requires a comprehensive approach to error handling across the entire application. The complexity comes from identifying all possible error scenarios, creating user-friendly messages, and implementing appropriate recovery mechanisms."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Voice Loading and Initialization",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the voice initialization implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating the voice preloading utility, 2) Implementing browser-specific initialization logic, 3) Adding retry and fallback mechanisms",
      "reasoning": "This task deals with browser-specific behavior for speech synthesis voice loading. The complexity comes from handling the asynchronous nature of voice loading, browser differences, and implementing reliable fallbacks."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Application State Management",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the state management implementation into subtasks for: 1) Defining the state machine/reducer structure, 2) Implementing state transitions and actions, 3) Connecting UI components to state, 4) Adding persistence logic, 5) Testing state transitions",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing a comprehensive state management solution. The complexity is high because it requires understanding all possible application states, transitions between them, and ensuring the UI correctly reflects each state."
