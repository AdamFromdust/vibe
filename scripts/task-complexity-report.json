      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Text-to-Speech implementation into subtasks including: 1) Core TTS utility function creation, 2) Voice selection and fallback logic, 3) TTS playback control implementation, and 4) Error handling and browser compatibility testing.",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity task with clear requirements and provided code example. The Web Speech API is standardized but has browser-specific quirks. The task involves voice selection logic, error handling, and integration with existing components."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the error handling implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Reusable error components creation, 2) API and network error handling, 3) User input validation, 4) Loading state indicators, and 5) Toast notification system for transient feedback.",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity due to the comprehensive nature of error handling across multiple components and scenarios. Requires careful consideration of user experience, different error types, retry mechanisms, and visual feedback systems."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the voice loading implementation into: 1) Voice initialization utility with browser compatibility handling, 2) Voice loading state management and retry mechanism, and 3) Integration with the main application flow.",
      "reasoning": "Moderately complex due to the asynchronous nature of voice loading and browser-specific implementations. Requires careful handling of timing issues, event listeners, and fallback mechanisms."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Application State Management",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the state management implementation into: 1) State interface and initial state definition, 2) Action types and reducer implementation, 3) State transitions for user input flow, 4) State transitions for visualization and TTS, 5) Error state handling, and 6) State persistence mechanism.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity task that affects the entire application architecture. Requires careful design of state machine/reducer, comprehensive action types, and ensuring all components correctly respond to state changes. The state management solution needs to handle multiple async operations and user interactions."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the final integration and testing into: 1) Component integration and dependency resolution, 2) End-to-end user flow testing, 3) Cross-browser compatibility testing, 4) Mobile and responsive design testing, 5) Accessibility compliance verification, 6) Performance optimization, and 7) Deployment preparation and verification.",
      "reasoning": "Highest complexity task that requires integrating all previous components and ensuring they work together seamlessly. Involves comprehensive testing across browsers and devices, performance optimization, accessibility verification, and deployment preparation. This task is critical for project completion and requires attention to numerous details."
