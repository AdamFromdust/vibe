# Executive Summary for Task 2: Implement Geolocation Service

Task 2, "Implement Geolocation Service," has been completed. A new service file `lib/services/geolocation-service.ts` was created, containing an asynchronous function `getUserLocation()`. 

This function attempts to retrieve the user's current location using the browser's Geolocation API. It includes logic for reverse geocoding coordinates to a human-readable location (e.g., city, country) using the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API (`https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse`).

Comprehensive fallback mechanisms are in place:
- If the Geolocation API is not available in the browser.
- If the user denies permission for location access.
- If the `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` call times out (internal timeout of 5 seconds).
- If the entire `getUserLocation` operation exceeds an overall timeout (6 seconds).
- If the reverse geocoding API request fails or returns an error.
- If a usable location name cannot be extracted from the geocoding data.

In any of these fallback scenarios, the function will resolve to the string "in a faraway land".

The implementation includes:
- A check to ensure `navigator.geolocation` is only accessed in a browser environment.
- Robust timeout handling with a `resolved` flag to prevent multiple resolutions.
- Console warnings for various states (API unavailable, errors, timeouts) to aid debugging.
- Use of `enableHighAccuracy: false` for `getCurrentPosition` to potentially save battery.
- Requesting English language results from Nominatim (`accept-language=en`).

The new code was successfully linted using `pnpm lint`, indicating it is type-safe and adheres to project coding standards.

The service is now ready to be integrated into the frontend to provide location data for other features.
