## Task 3: Create Backend API Endpoint for Visualization Generation - Implementation Report

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

**Summary:**
Task 3, "Create Backend API Endpoint for Visualization Generation," has been successfully implemented. A new Next.js API route was established at `app/api/magic-button/generate-visualization/route.ts` to handle the generation of visualization text based on user input.

**Key Features Implemented:**
1.  **API Endpoint Creation:** A new `POST` endpoint was created at `/app/api/magic-button/generate-visualization/route.ts`.
2.  **Input Handling:** The endpoint accepts `dreamText` (string, required) and an optional `location` (string) in the JSON request body.
3.  **Input Validation:**
    *   Ensures `dreamText` is provided and is a non-empty string.
    *   Handles cases where `location` is missing by defaulting to "in a faraway land".
4.  **Environment Variable Check:** Verifies the presence of the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before attempting to initialize the OpenAI client. Returns a 500 error if the key is not set, with a console error indicating the issue.
5.  **OpenAI Integration:**
    *   Utilizes the `openai` npm package (version ^4.98.0 was installed).
    *   Constructs a Katathym Imaginative Psychotherapy (KIP)-inspired prompt based on the user's `dreamText` and `location`.
    *   Calls the OpenAI Chat Completions API using the `gpt-4.1-mini` model, as specified in the task requirements.
    *   Sets `temperature` to 0.7 and `max_tokens` to 1000.
6.  **Response Handling:**
    *   On success, returns a JSON response with the `{ visualizationText: string }`.
    *   Handles cases where the OpenAI response might not contain visualization text, returning a 500 error.
7.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Catches and handles various errors, including:
        *   `SyntaxError` for malformed JSON requests (returns 400).
        *   Errors during the OpenAI API call (returns 500).
        *   Other unexpected server-side errors (returns 500).
    *   Logs error details to the console for debugging, using `JSON.stringify` for objects as per logging guidelines.
    *   Provides generic, user-friendly error messages in the API response to avoid leaking sensitive internal details.
8.  **TypeScript:** The route handler is written in TypeScript, with interfaces defined for request and response bodies to ensure type safety.
9.  **Code Quality:**
    *   The `openai` package was installed via `pnpm add openai`.
    *   An initial `no-explicit-any` ESLint error in the `catch` block was resolved by changing `error: any` to `error: unknown` and implementing proper type guards.
    *   The code passed `pnpm lint` with no warnings or errors.

**Files Created/Modified:**
*   `app/api/magic-button/generate-visualization/route.ts` (Created)
*   `package.json` (Modified - `openai` added to dependencies)
*   `pnpm-lock.yaml` (Modified - due to `openai` installation)
*   `tests/instructions/unit-test/3_unit-test-instructions.md` (Created - contains detailed test cases for the API route)

**Next Steps (Testing):**
- Implement the unit and integration tests as outlined in `tests/instructions/unit-test/3_unit-test-instructions.md`.
- Perform E2E testing by sending requests to the running API endpoint (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set in the environment).
